# Destiny
 # Express TypeScript Starter Project with MongoDB, User Authentication, and Testing

## Introduction
This is a starter project for building a RESTful API using Express, TypeScript, MongoDB, and Jest for testing. It includes user authentication and a simple test route.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- MongoDB installed and running

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/express-typescript-starter.git
```
2. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

## Configuration
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
```
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
```
2. Replace `your-database-name` with the name of the MongoDB database you want to use.

## Running the Server
1. Start MongoDB.
2. Run the following command to start the server:
```
npm start
```
The server will listen on port 7000 by default.

## Routes
The project includes the following routes:
- `/api/auth`: Authentication routes for user registration and login.
- `/api/users`: User management routes for CRUD operations.
- `/test`: A simple test route to verify that the server is running.

## Testing
The project includes a simple test for the `/test` route. To run the tests, run the following command:
```
npm test
```

## Conclusion
This starter project provides a solid foundation for building a RESTful API with Express, TypeScript, MongoDB, and Jest for testing. It includes user authentication and a simple test route, and can be easily customized to meet your specific requirements.


 ## User Schema for Mongoose

This is a user schema for Mongoose, a popular object modeling tool for MongoDB. It defines the structure and properties of a user document in a MongoDB database.

### Prerequisites

To use this schema, you will need to have:

- Node.js and npm installed
- MongoDB installed and running
- Mongoose installed (```npm install mongoose```)
- Bcryptjs installed (```npm install bcryptjs```)

### Usage

To use this schema, you can import it into your Node.js script and create a model based on it:

```typescript
import mongoose from "mongoose";
import { UserType } from "./user-schema";

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema<UserType>(
  {
    email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
    password: { type: String, required: true },
    firstName: { type: String, required: true },
    lastName: { type: String, required: true },
  },
  { versionKey: false }
);

const User = mongoose.model<UserType>("User", userSchema);
```

### Schema Details

The schema defines the following properties for a user document:

- `_id`: This is the unique identifier for each user document. It is automatically generated by MongoDB and should not be set manually.
- `email`: This is the email address of the user. It is required and must be unique.
- `password`: This is the password of the user. It is required and is hashed using bcryptjs before being stored in the database.
- `firstName`: This is the first name of the user. It is required.
- `lastName`: This is the last name of the user. It is required.

### Pre-save Middleware

The schema also defines a pre-save middleware function. This function is executed before a user document is saved to the database. It checks if the `password` field has been modified. If so, it hashes the password using bcryptjs and then allows the save operation to proceed. This is a common practice for securing user passwords by storing only their hashed versions in the database.

### Conclusion

This user schema provides a secure and flexible way to store user data in a MongoDB database. It can be used in a variety of applications, such as authentication systems, user management systems, and e-commerce platforms.



 # User Login API with Express and JWT

This is a simple user login API built with Express and JWT. It allows users to log in to the system by providing their email and password. If the credentials are valid, a JWT token is generated and sent back to the client.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- A MongoDB database
- A JWT secret key (stored in a `.env` file)

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/user-login-api-express-jwt.git
cd user-login-api-express-jwt
npm install
```

## Configuration

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and add your database connection string and JWT secret key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Usage

Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login`.

## Code Walkthrough

### 1. Import the necessary modules

```typescript
import express, { Request, Response } from "express";
import { check, validationResult } from "express-validator";
import { User } from "../models/user.model";
import bcryptjs from "bcryptjs";
import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";
```

- `express`: The Express framework for building web applications.
- `express-validator`: A library for validating user input.
- `User`: The User model from the database.
- `bcryptjs`: A library for hashing passwords.
- `jwt`: A library for generating JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

### 2. Define the login route

```typescript
router.post(
  "/login",
  [
    check("email", "Email is required").isEmail(),
    check(
      "password",
      "Password with 6 or more charecters is required"
    ).isLength({ min: 6 }),
  ],
  async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
    // ...
  }
);
```

- The `"/login"` route is defined using the `router.post()` method.
- The route is protected with the `express-validator` middleware, which validates the user input.
- The `check()` method is used to define

 # User Authentication with JWT and Cookies

This Node.js script provides a secure user authentication mechanism using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and HTTP cookies. It's designed to be part of a larger Express-based application.

## Functionality Overview

The script handles user registration and sets a secure HTTP cookie named "auth_token" upon successful authentication.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. Importing Necessary Modules

```typescript
import express, { Request, Response, Router } from "express";
import { User } from "../models/user.model";
import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";
import { check, validationResult } from "express-validator";
```
- We import the necessary modules and components from Express, our User model, JWT, and Express Validator for input validation.

### 2. Defining the Express Router

```typescript
const router = Router();
```
- We create an Express router to handle our authentication routes.

### 3. User Registration Route

```typescript
router.post(
  "/register",
  [
    check("email", "Please include a valid email").isEmail(),
    check(
      "password",
      "Please enter a password with 6 or more characters"
    ).isLength({ min: 6 }),
    check("firstName", "Please enter a first name").isString(),
    check("lastName", "Please enter a last name").isString(),
  ],
  async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
    // Check for errors
    const errors = validationResult(req);
    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
      return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
    }
```
- We define a POST route for user registration.
- We use Express Validator to validate the user's input, ensuring that the email is valid, the password is at least 6 characters long, and the first and last names are provided.

### 4. Checking for Existing User

```typescript
    try {
      let user = await User.findOne({
        email: req.body.email,
      });
      if (user) {
        return res.status(400).json({ msg: `User already exists` });
      }
```
- We check if a user with the provided email already exists in our database.
